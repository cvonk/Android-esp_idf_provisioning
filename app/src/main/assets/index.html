                Welcome to OPNpool Provisioning
            </h2>
            <p>
                The OPNpool device connects your pool controller to your Wi-Fi network.
                It keeps a tab on the status of the controller, the pool pump and the chlorinator.
                It is not only more convenient than walking over to the pool equipment, but will
                also tell you about problems with e.g. the chlorinator or pump.
            </p>
